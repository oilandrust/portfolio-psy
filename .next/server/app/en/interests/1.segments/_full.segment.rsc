10:T537,Hello, I'm Olivier, I'm 38 years old. I'm a Psychology student at the **University of Strasbourg**, returning to studies. Before that, I was a software engineer, notably in video games. I have a strong interest in psychotherapy and I wish to complete a Master's in Clinical Psychology to become a psychologist.

In parallel with my university studies, I have followed professional training in psychotherapy. Notably, I have completed levels 1 and 2 of training in **'Hakomi Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy'** with the Hakomi Institute of California. One could translate 'Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy' as **'Mindful Somatic Psychotherapy'**. See the 'Interests' section for more on this subject.

The clinical orientation that inspires me is influenced by **Psychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Approaches**, by Somatic approaches to treating **Psychotrauma** (Polyvagal Theory, Somatic Experiencing), by **Mindfulness** and **Relational Approaches**. I am also interested in the contributions of **Neuroscience** to understand mechanisms of change, and to understand the neuropsychological and developmental foundations of these therapies.

Although I have a scientific mind and an interest in research in psychology and neuropsychology, my interest is to use models to inform a **Psychotherapy** practice whose essence is **Experiential**.4:["$","div",null,{"className":"App","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"fallbackMessage":"This component encountered an error.

14:Ta0c,My current interest in psychotherapy is nurtured by psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches, with influence from French psychoanalysis and recent American formulations.

These approaches have in my view highlighted central aspects for healing, first the notion of the **affective unconscious**, first brought forward by Freud and then taken up in more modern contexts.

Psychoanalysis gave rise to Bowlby's theory of **attachment** (Bowlby 2008), which clearly showed the importance of the quality of the bond in the first years of life for the establishment of *Inner Working Models*, another model of the unconscious.

I am also particularly interested in the modern contributions made by Allan Schore (Schore 2019), an American Psychoanalyst who explains the relational affective unconscious as a way of being with the other that is **implicit**, **non-verbal**, and therefore unconscious, and whose neural substrates can be observed activating in relationship.

Another fundamental contribution from Freud's work is the notion of **transference** (Freud 1912), where these implicit and unconscious models play out in the dyadic patient-therapist relationship, offering the possibility of a corrective experience leading to a new way of being with the other and the emergence of the ego or *Self*.

Finally, Freud brought his descriptions of **psychic organizations**, neurotic, narcissistic, psychotic, etc. (Bergeret 2021) which are in my view essential when working with a patient in psychotherapy. How much does the person in front of us have access to a solid self?

In my view, the concepts of the unconscious, attachment models, transference and psychic structures are fundamental concepts for approaching a psychotherapy that will be adapted to the person we encounter, and it is important for a therapist to train to recognize these phenomena and structures, and this not only **in discourse**, but also and especially **in the implicit and non-verbal**, with our ***right brain*** as Allan Schore suggests.

Christine Caldwell, founder of the Somatic Psychology Department at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, traces the history of body-oriented methods (Caldwell & Hendricks, 1997).

She notably traces the origins of somatic therapies in Psychoanalysis: starting with Freud, Josef Breuer who focused on the nervous system, Ferenczi who asked his patients to abstain from certain repetitive movements to exacerbate the emotional charge they were dissipating, then Reich who had identified neuroses as character armors that manifested through tensions in certain parts of the body.

Eugene Gendlin was probably one of the first to emphasize *the felt sense of bodily sensations* in his psychotherapy **Focusing** (Gendlin 1981). Focusing consists of directing attention to bodily sensations associated with a problem or belief and allowing symbols to emerge. This is already an exploration of the unconscious through bodily sensations.

More recently, bodily sensations have received more attention thanks to discoveries by Damasio and his **Somatic Marker Theory** (Bechara & Damasio, 2005). It has now been shown that the integration of bodily sensations has an impact on behaviors and the processing of emotions. It is likely that somatic approaches will have growing interest from CBT approaches.

Another major influence is Steven Porges's **Polyvagal Theory** (Porges, 2011), which describes the different activation modes of the autonomic nervous system, with the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the vagal nervous system. To summarize, these are the modes *Fight*, *Flight*, *Freeze*.

Peter Levine was one of the first to study nervous system regulation systems in animals under threat conditions. He then applied these observations to help patients out of chronic stress related, following his model, to a blockage of the autonomic nervous system in Freeze mode. This gave rise to **Somatic Experiencing** therapy (Levine, 1997), which is recognized as an effective method for managing psychotrauma. There is evidence of its effectiveness for treating **PTSD** (Brom et al. 2017).

Methods like Somatic Experiencing can be broadened to address not only shock traumas, such as accidents, violence, etc., but also developmental trauma where the child is exposed to situations of chronic stress or more benign conditions that lead to *Self* atrophy, porous boundaries, etc.

Among the methods that treat developmental and attachment trauma, we can note **NARM** (Neuro Affective Relational Model) (Heller, 2012), **Sensorimotor Psychotherapy** (Ogden 2015), **Hakomi** (Kurtz 2015), and also **Somatic Transformation** (Stanley 2025).

Today somatic methods have a very strong influence in the United States, there are 3 Master's programs specializing in Somatic Psychotherapy, and these methods are used for psychedelic-assisted therapies (Mischke-Reeds, 2025).
# Hakomi Somatic Therapy
Hakomi (Kurtz, 2015; Weiss et al., 2015) is the main therapy modality in which I am trained, it largely forms the basis of the idea of psychotherapy that I want to practice.

It is difficult to describe the processes at play in a Hakomi session and I think you need to experience it to represent it, but I will try to give some principles.

First, there is great emotional proximity between the therapist and client, a Hakomi therapist learns to be very finely attuned to the patient's internal state and adapts in real time to their changes. This is analogous to the attunement we observe between a caregiver and a baby. This very fine attunement allows for great safety in the client and the progressive opening of defenses. This allows for welcoming and regulating all the states that can arise.

Once this "therapeutic bubble" is established, and following either the therapist's observations or a problem presented by the client, the therapeutic process can begin. The idea is to study in mindfulness how the said problem arises in the patient. What are the thoughts, emotions, sensations, movements, postures that are manifest, and what are the unconscious mechanisms, beliefs, learning, trauma that are underlying?
By studying manifest phenomena in mindfulness and immersing the client in this experience, we can access deeper unconscious structures and transform them.

Here is a commented example of a Hakomi therapy session by the founder of the method, Ron Kurtz, where a gesture is used as an entry point to access a traumatic event and transform the associated memory/belief.

Norton & company.16:T902,Since the third wave of CBT, mindfulness has been widely adopted as one of the tools for psychotherapy (Segal et al. 2018). It has been shown that the practice of mindfulness has positive effects on emotional regulation, and in CBT, these tools are used to allow patients to step back from their experience, to name their emotions, to accept discomfort and to recognize their thoughts as what they are: thoughts and not realities.

However, I would like to highlight that these contributions, although important, are only part of what mindfulness can bring to Psychotherapy.

In mindful psychotherapies, we do not use mindfulness as a stress management tool that patients can learn and use themselves, but we conduct psychotherapy itself in a state of mindfulness.

This "two-person" mindfulness was glimpsed by Freud in free association (Freud 1895). By freely associating ideas and simply noticing what arises, thoughts, emotions, etc., we are indeed practicing mindfulness.

Moreover, the contribution of the therapist's presence allows the patient to have more capacity to be in contact with their experience. The therapist operating as the caregiver who helps the child to regulate their emotions.

This approach to therapy, notably proposed by Hakomi (Kurtz 2015), Daniel Siegel (Siegel 2007), allows for the study of the psycho-corporeal apparatus as Freud might have dreamed, not in analysis after the fact but in the present embodied moment. This also gives access to modified states of consciousness and neuroplasticity that allows rapid transformation of unconscious material, limiting schemas and working models of attachment (Rhonda 2020).

Indeed, the two disciplines (East-West) are engaged in understanding human experience, how it produces suffering and how we can reduce it.

At the heart of mindfulness is from a certain point of view a phenomenological approach: *what are the objects of our experience*. By observing the content of our experience we thus distinguish sensations, thoughts and emotions. In the practice of **insight meditation** (Kornfield, 1993; Young, 2018; Ingram 2018), we simply strive to note these phenomena: "hey, a thought", "an emotion", "a bodily sensation", ... We can extend these classifications and notice more subtle phenomena: an intention, a memory, an image, a memory of an emotion. Or be interested in the qualities of phenomena: "this sadness is felt in the body, from here, to there, it makes me think of something wet and cold."

We can still go in the opposite direction and note our states of consciousness: first crude: wakefulness, awakening, drowsiness. When we continue to deconstruct experience we can note other aspects like *the sense of being separate*, or *the sense of being one with something* (Non-dualism), the sense of being identified with one's thoughts or on the contrary the disidentification with them (Martin, 2019).

*Insight* meditation, from which mindfulness largely comes, offers us a path through the objects of experience toward non-dual states of consciousness, which can be analogous to the undifferentiated states of the first years of development. This is perhaps one of the most striking links in the correspondences between Eastern and Western psychology, with important implications for psychotherapy. Jeffery A. Martin, an American psychologist and researcher, has established a classification of such experiences (Martin, 2020).

In psychotherapy, our patients will experience a whole range of experiences, some that we know, others perhaps less so. What is it like to feel the inner emptiness described in borderline psychic organization?

Also during analytic psychotherapy we will observe different states of consciousness: Is the person there as an adult or are they regressed to a younger stage of development? How to recognize it and how to respond? Perhaps they are dissociated, or frozen.

Having explored for oneself the diversity of human experiences and training through observation is in my view a valid path to psychotherapy.

These practices are very strong in California or Colorado and also present in Scandinavia and Germany. They are however rare and emerging in France, perhaps because the French are slower to adopt innovations, or perhaps because of the language, these practices being generally transmitted in English.

These practices, which can be affiliated with active listening or non-violent communication, are nourished by mindfulness and psychotherapy and offer tools and practices that allow us to bring more awareness into relationships, to develop empathy, connection with the other and the body and more.

They are interesting for me not only because they have brought me in my process of maturity and healing, but also because they have the potential to transform how we are in relationship in society and bring out certain relational qualities from the closed frame of psychotherapy. They are also for me a playground to practice my relational and therapeutic skills.

My goal here is not to describe these practices precisely but to give a taste of 3 main practices: Circling (BENETEAU, 2021), Authentic Relating (Kestano, 2022) or Authentic Relations and finally somatic practices which encompass a variety of practices.

### Circling, relational mindfulness

Circling, also known in Europe as Transformational Connection, is one of the flagship practices.

The exercise in Circling is to explore, in a group, what our experience is in the present moment. It is about both revealing one's own experience and also being interested in the other's experience, here and now (Rouiller 2025), not in the narration of a past experience or a general life experience.

So for me it is a relational or group mindfulness.

So one could say "Being here with you, I notice a desire to speak and take space, but also shame. And now that I'm speaking I feel my hands becoming sweaty but seeing you attentive, I notice that I relax a bit", someone could continue by revealing how this sharing impacts them or by asking questions to learn more about this experience.

How these questions articulate at different levels and through different lenses, from somatic psychology, attachment theory to economics and psychoanalysis.

My path to therapy was notably due to relational problems and understanding how to establish sexual relationships was an important issue. These questions are therefore at the heart of my personal journey and they are also strong in society.

Today there is a strong polarization between the sexes and genders. In my view, this polarization is the legacy of history, hundreds of years of domination, transgression and character adaptations. We are at a time when these structures are unravelling and with that a significant traumatic charge is unfolding.

The work is not only to dialogue, to set new boundaries, to learn to respect them but also to regulate this charge to gradually also let go of defense and domination strategies.

In my view, somatic approaches have an important role to play as they provide a framework to welcome emotions, energies, charges, etc. that arise when we approach these issues, to regulate them and to return to society, not in Fight or Flight, not in Freeze or Collapse, but with empathy, curiosity and capacity for connection.5:["$","$L12",null,{"currentLang":"en","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"section","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"À propos"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","p","p-0",{"style":{"marginBottom":"1rem","lineHeight":"1.6"},"children":["Hello, I'm Olivier, I'm 38 years old.

1f:T559,How to translate 'Embodied'? Incarnate could pass but I'm not satisfied. Here we refer to a whole movement of personal development internationally, dominated by English, the concept of Embodiment, which I would simply translate as... Embodiment.

Embodiment is the art and practice of reconnecting to one's body, to one's sensations, instincts, etc. This happens through movement practices like yoga, dance, different forms of conscious movement. This also happens through trauma work, because to survive in our society, and under the influence of a traumatic childhood for example, we learn to dissociate, we become 'numb', because we avoid emotions, unpleasant sensations.

The price to pay for this dissociation is misery, and a disconnection from our environment, an insensitivity to oneself and to others.

Or on the contrary our experience is far too sensitive and our emotions are overwhelming, there is no 'self' to contain them.

So the Embodiment movement, and this work, one among many that describes practices that allow us to turn our attention toward the body, in safety, and to reconstruct a fragmented sense of self. To regulate what emerges, and to rebuild the neural networks from our guts to our conscious attention.

These practices are for me linked to trauma therapy and necessary aids on the path of integration of our psycho-corporeal apparatus.20:T559,How to translate 'Embodied'?
