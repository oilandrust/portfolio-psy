4:T537,Hello, I'm Olivier, I'm 38 years old. I'm a Psychology student at the **University of Strasbourg**, returning to studies. Before that, I was a software engineer, notably in video games. I have a strong interest in psychotherapy and I wish to complete a Master's in Clinical Psychology to become a psychologist.

In parallel with my university studies, I have followed professional training in psychotherapy. Notably, I have completed levels 1 and 2 of training in **'Hakomi Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy'** with the Hakomi Institute of California. One could translate 'Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy' as **'Mindful Somatic Psychotherapy'**. See the 'Interests' section for more on this subject.

The clinical orientation that inspires me is influenced by **Psychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Approaches**, by Somatic approaches to treating **Psychotrauma** (Polyvagal Theory, Somatic Experiencing), by **Mindfulness** and **Relational Approaches**. I am also interested in the contributions of **Neuroscience** to understand mechanisms of change, and to understand the neuropsychological and developmental foundations of these therapies.

Although I have a scientific mind and an interest in research in psychology and neuropsychology, my interest is to use models to inform a **Psychotherapy** practice whose essence is **Experiential**.0:{"buildId":"NN_uMQuN3xb7lEsa7MFCT","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/fdf6c8047a4ec353.css","precedence":"next"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/8faaa2e7c9562b16.js","async":true}]],["$","div",null,{"className":"App","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"fallbackMessage":"This component encountered an error.
