10:T537,Hello, I'm Olivier, I'm 38 years old. I'm a Psychology student at the **University of Strasbourg**, returning to studies. Before that, I was a software engineer, notably in video games. I have a strong interest in psychotherapy and I wish to complete a Master's in Clinical Psychology to become a psychologist.

In parallel with my university studies, I have followed professional training in psychotherapy. Notably, I have completed levels 1 and 2 of training in **'Hakomi Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy'** with the Hakomi Institute of California. One could translate 'Somatic Mindful Psychotherapy' as **'Mindful Somatic Psychotherapy'**. See the 'Interests' section for more on this subject.

The clinical orientation that inspires me is influenced by **Psychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Approaches**, by Somatic approaches to treating **Psychotrauma** (Polyvagal Theory, Somatic Experiencing), by **Mindfulness** and **Relational Approaches**. I am also interested in the contributions of **Neuroscience** to understand mechanisms of change, and to understand the neuropsychological and developmental foundations of these therapies.

Although I have a scientific mind and an interest in research in psychology and neuropsychology, my interest is to use models to inform a **Psychotherapy** practice whose essence is **Experiential**.4:["$","div",null,{"className":"App","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"fallbackMessage":"This component encountered an error.

14:T559,How to translate 'Embodied'? Incarnate could pass but I'm not satisfied. Here we refer to a whole movement of personal development internationally, dominated by English, the concept of Embodiment, which I would simply translate as... Embodiment.

Embodiment is the art and practice of reconnecting to one's body, to one's sensations, instincts, etc. This happens through movement practices like yoga, dance, different forms of conscious movement. This also happens through trauma work, because to survive in our society, and under the influence of a traumatic childhood for example, we learn to dissociate, we become 'numb', because we avoid emotions, unpleasant sensations.

The price to pay for this dissociation is misery, and a disconnection from our environment, an insensitivity to oneself and to others.

Or on the contrary our experience is far too sensitive and our emotions are overwhelming, there is no 'self' to contain them.

So the Embodiment movement, and this work, one among many that describes practices that allow us to turn our attention toward the body, in safety, and to reconstruct a fragmented sense of self. To regulate what emerges, and to rebuild the neural networks from our guts to our conscious attention.

These practices are for me linked to trauma therapy and necessary aids on the path of integration of our psycho-corporeal apparatus.15:T559,How to translate 'Embodied'?
