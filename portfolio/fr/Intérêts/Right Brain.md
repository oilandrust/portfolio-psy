Synchronisation of the Right Temporal Junctions during imitation of movements:
Attention processing, perceptual awareness, face and voice processing, empathic understanding

Right to right brain sync (Right temporo-parietal)

“both partners mutually learned to adjust to each other”
right temporal lobes
interpersonal synchro-nization occurred only in pairs with shared communicative history
These authors documented that in this nonverbal intersubjective communication, the processing of novelty and meaning is generated in the right (and not left) hemisphere.

neural activity in the right temporal lobe and right ventromedial cortex (both limbic structures) when two individuals generate and understand novel shared symbols during live communicative interactions (Stolk et al., 2013).

the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS).

crucial role of the right pSTS for processing pragmatic aspects of linguistic material (Jung-Beeman et al., 2004; Mashal et al., 2007), an instance of the right-hemispheric dominance for inferring the communicative intentions of a conversational partner (Sabbagh, 1999).

functional neuroimaging research is now exploring the critical role of the right hemisphere in adult social interactions (Semrud-Clikeman, Fine, & Zhu, 2011). Indeed, live face-to-face interaction during fMRI shows “greater activation in brain regions involved in social cognition and reward, including the right temporoparietal junction, anterior cingulate cortex, right superior temporal sulcus, ventral striatum, and amygdala” (Redcay et al., 2010, p. 1639).

Other imaging studies now demonstrate that a flow of affective information exists between communicating brains (Anders et al., 2011), and that emotions promote social interactions by synchronizing brain activity across individuals (Nummenmaa et al., 2012). These studies clearly describe events within the face-to-face context of psychotherapy.

“hypothesis and theory” article, “Neural Substrate of Group Mental Health: Insights from Multi-brain Reference Frame in Functional Neuroimaging,” in which they argued that all mental disorders unfold in an interpersonal context, and that a great deal of relevant information regarding mental health is contained in the interpersonal interactions that cannot be fully captured by limiting our search to markers of individual brains.

Ray and his colleagues (2017) asserted that among all forms of interbrain communications, the communication of emotion is the most important process to mental health.

With respect to psychopathology, they argued that the interpersonal perspective of between-brain functional connectivity can allow for a deeper understanding of the relational deficits of depression, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, social anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, sexual dysfunctions, and suicide. Most intriguingly, they see the direct application of this paradigm shift in interbrain neuroimaging to the therapeutic alliance, which is defined as the collaborative bond between patient and therapist and now considered as “the quintessential integrative variable” (Wolfe & Goldfried, 1988). Furthermore, they stressed the need for interbrain connectivity between the patient and the therapist, especially for early detection and repair of rupture of the therapeutic alliance.
