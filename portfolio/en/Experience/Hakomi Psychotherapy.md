title: Hakomi Somatic Psychotherapy
subtitle: Practice of Hakomi therapy in real conditions
---
While completing the first level of my training in Hakomi somatic psychotherapy, I began working with clients in real conditions. My practice remained modest, commensurate with my abilities, but I had the honor of meeting many different systems and following two patients regularly. The clients I worked with are generally people with extensive experience in psychotherapy, sometimes themselves psychologists who are turning to somatic therapy.

Notably 'N', whom I followed for more than a year with almost weekly sessions who presented an avoidant attachment style. We worked to allow them to connect to their attachment needs and to feel more emotions.

I also worked regularly with 'H' who is both a friend, meditator and apprentice in therapy and other somatic practices. With them the work was more about personal development but we worked occasionally on early trauma.
