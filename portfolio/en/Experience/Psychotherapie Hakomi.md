title: Psychothérapie Somatique Hakomi
subtitle: Practicing Hakomi Therapy in Real-World Conditions
---

As I completed the first level of my Hakomi somatic psychotherapy training, I began working with clients in real-world conditions. My practice remained modest, within the scope of my abilities, but I had the honor of encountering many different systems and following two patients regularly. The clients I worked with are generally individuals with extensive psychotherapy experience who are turning to somatic therapy.

Notably 'N', whom I followed for over a year with nearly weekly sessions, presented an avoidant attachment style. We worked to enable him to connect with his attachment needs and to feel more emotions.

I also worked regularly with 'H', who is simultaneously a friend, meditator, and apprentice in therapy and other somatic practices. With him, the work leaned more towards personal development, but we addressed quite early traumas.

My practice's website is online www.re-connected.fr
