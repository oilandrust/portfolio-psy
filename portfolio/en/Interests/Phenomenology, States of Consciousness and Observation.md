It is in my view no accident that mindfulness is making its way into psychotherapy. Indeed, the two disciplines (East-West) are engaged in understanding human experience, how it produces suffering and how we can reduce it.

At the heart of mindfulness is from a certain point of view a phenomenological approach: *what are the objects of our experience*. By observing the content of our experience we thus distinguish sensations, thoughts and emotions. In the practice of **insight meditation** (Kornfield, 1993; Young, 2018; Ingram 2018), we simply strive to note these phenomena: "hey, a thought", "an emotion", "a bodily sensation", ... We can extend these classifications and notice more subtle phenomena: an intention, a memory, an image, a memory of an emotion. Or be interested in the qualities of phenomena: "this sadness is felt in the body, from here, to there, it makes me think of something wet and cold."

We can still go in the opposite direction and note our states of consciousness: first crude: wakefulness, awakening, drowsiness. When we continue to deconstruct experience we can note other aspects like *the sense of being separate*, or *the sense of being one with something* (Non-dualism), the sense of being identified with one's thoughts or on the contrary the disidentification with them (Martin, 2019).

*Insight* meditation, from which mindfulness largely comes, offers us a path through the objects of experience toward non-dual states of consciousness, which can be analogous to the undifferentiated states of the first years of development. This is perhaps one of the most striking links in the correspondences between Eastern and Western psychology, with important implications for psychotherapy. Jeffery A. Martin, an American psychologist and researcher, has established a classification of such experiences (Martin, 2020).

In psychotherapy, our patients will experience a whole range of experiences, some that we know, others perhaps less so. What is it like to feel the inner emptiness described in borderline psychic organization?

Also during analytic psychotherapy we will observe different states of consciousness: Is the person there as an adult or are they regressed to a younger stage of development? How to recognize it and how to respond? Perhaps they are dissociated, or frozen.

Having explored for oneself the diversity of human experiences and training through observation is in my view a valid path to psychotherapy.
