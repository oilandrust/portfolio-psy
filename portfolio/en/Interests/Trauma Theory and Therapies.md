*Draft in progress...*

I am influenced by current therapeutic trends that attribute significant importance to trauma in understanding psychological difficulties and in the approach used to address them. Furthermore, there is the idea that traumas leave their mark on the body.

These ideas have gained popularity in mainstream culture, they resonated with me when I was looking for answers, and they have scientific bases that continue to be developed. Finally, in my opinion, thinking about psychological difficulties in terms of trauma allows for the development of therapeutic methods that are conceptually sound and appear effective in practice.

In what follows, I will provide a brief introduction to these models and how they apply in experiential therapies that can be integrated into both CBT and psychoanalytic practice.

My understanding, and the hypothesis I want to explore, is the following:
Starting from vagal theory, we will see how it can be applied to the resolution of shock traumas such as PTSD and how it can be used to regulate regressed states that can occur in relational therapies.
## Polyvagal Theory

At the heart of many trauma therapies is Polyvagal Theory, which describes the different modes of functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Porges starts from the observation that when animals are in a dangerous situation, their nervous system activates different modes depending on the situation. If there is a chance of survival in confrontation, the Fight mode will be activated. If, on the contrary, the chances are low, the animal will flee (Flight). In both cases, energy is mobilized for action; these two modes are hyperactivated and are associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

Porges also observes that animals in flight mode suddenly freeze when they perceive that they have no chance of survival by fleeing. The strategy is then to play dead, hoping the predator will abandon it. This is referred to as Freeze mode. It is the dorsal branch of the parasympathetic nervous system. This mode is also described as hypoactive. Some more recent models also feature the Collapse mode.

Finally, when animals, and more specifically mammals, are in a state of safety with their peers, the nervous system is in rest and digest mode, or the Social Engagement System. For humans, it is in this mode that we have access to empathy and emotional regulation within connection.
## Psychotrauma According to Polyvagal Theory

According to this model, psychotrauma, and in its most acute form PTSD, is linked to a system that has remained stuck in Freeze mode.

Levine observes that when a possum plays dead, if by chance the predator abandons it, it spontaneously emerges from its immobility with erratic movements resembling undirected attacks, or tremors. There is a discharge of energy, and then suddenly the animal resumes its normal functioning mode.

According to Levine, psychotrauma in humans is due to the fact that, when we emerge from a traumatic situation, there has been no discharge, and our nervous system remains stuck in survival mode. It's as if the threat is still present. Levine hypothesizes that the prefrontal cortex inhibits the sympathetic discharge seen in animals, which would allow the mobilization cycle to complete. This gave rise to Somatic Experiencing therapy.
## Somatic Experiencing

From these observations, Peter Levine developed his Somatic Experiencing therapy.
