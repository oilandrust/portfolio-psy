# Somatic Therapies

Christine Caldwell, founder of the Somatic Psychology Department at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, traces the history of body-oriented methods (Caldwell & Hendricks, 1997).

She notably traces the origins of somatic therapies in Psychoanalysis: starting with Freud, Josef Breuer who focused on the nervous system, Ferenczi who asked his patients to abstain from certain repetitive movements to exacerbate the emotional charge they were dissipating, then Reich who had identified neuroses as character armors that manifested through tensions in certain parts of the body.

Eugene Gendlin was probably one of the first to emphasize *the felt sense of bodily sensations* in his psychotherapy **Focusing** (Gendlin 1981). Focusing consists of directing attention to bodily sensations associated with a problem or belief and allowing symbols to emerge. This is already an exploration of the unconscious through bodily sensations.

More recently, bodily sensations have received more attention thanks to discoveries by Damasio and his **Somatic Marker Theory** (Bechara & Damasio, 2005). It has now been shown that the integration of bodily sensations has an impact on behaviors and the processing of emotions. It is likely that somatic approaches will have growing interest from CBT approaches.

Another major influence is Steven Porges's **Polyvagal Theory** (Porges, 2011), which describes the different activation modes of the autonomic nervous system, with the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the vagal nervous system. To summarize, these are the modes *Fight*, *Flight*, *Freeze*.

Peter Levine was one of the first to study nervous system regulation systems in animals under threat conditions. He then applied these observations to help patients out of chronic stress related, following his model, to a blockage of the autonomic nervous system in Freeze mode. This gave rise to **Somatic Experiencing** therapy (Levine, 1997), which is recognized as an effective method for managing psychotrauma. There is evidence of its effectiveness for treating **PTSD** (Brom et al. 2017).

Methods like Somatic Experiencing can be broadened to address not only shock traumas, such as accidents, violence, etc., but also developmental trauma where the child is exposed to situations of chronic stress or more benign conditions that lead to *Self* atrophy, porous boundaries, etc.

Among the methods that treat developmental and attachment trauma, we can note **NARM** (Neuro Affective Relational Model) (Heller, 2012), **Sensorimotor Psychotherapy** (Ogden 2015), **Hakomi** (Kurtz 2015), and also **Somatic Transformation** (Stanley 2025).

Today somatic methods have a very strong influence in the United States, there are 3 Master's programs specializing in Somatic Psychotherapy, and these methods are used for psychedelic-assisted therapies (Mischke-Reeds, 2025).
# Hakomi Somatic Therapy
Hakomi (Kurtz, 2015; Weiss et al., 2015) is the main therapy modality in which I am trained, it largely forms the basis of the idea of psychotherapy that I want to practice.

It is difficult to describe the processes at play in a Hakomi session and I think you need to experience it to represent it, but I will try to give some principles.

First, there is great emotional proximity between the therapist and client, a Hakomi therapist learns to be very finely attuned to the patient's internal state and adapts in real time to their changes. This is analogous to the attunement we observe between a caregiver and a baby. This very fine attunement allows for great safety in the client and the progressive opening of defenses. This allows for welcoming and regulating all the states that can arise.

Once this "therapeutic bubble" is established, and following either the therapist's observations or a problem presented by the client, the therapeutic process can begin. The idea is to study in mindfulness how the said problem arises in the patient. What are the thoughts, emotions, sensations, movements, postures that are manifest, and what are the unconscious mechanisms, beliefs, learning, trauma that are underlying?
By studying manifest phenomena in mindfulness and immersing the client in this experience, we can access deeper unconscious structures and transform them.

Here is a commented example of a Hakomi therapy session by the founder of the method, Ron Kurtz, where a gesture is used as an entry point to access a traumatic event and transform the associated memory/belief.
