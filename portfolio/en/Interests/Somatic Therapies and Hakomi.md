# Somatic Therapies
Somatic therapies have origins in psychoanalysis. Obviously Freud and colleagues noticed the connection between the psyche and the body, and were interested in psychosomatic illnesses. Later, Wilhelm Reich identified body segments and their association with different energies. He greatly influenced this current.

Another major influence is Steven Porges's Polyvagal Theory, which describes the different activation modes of the autonomic nervous system, with the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the vagal nervous system.
To summarize, these are the modes ***Fight***, ***Flight***, ***Freeze***.
Peter Levine was one of the first to study nervous system regulation in animals under stress. He then applied these observations to help patients out of chronic stress related, according to his model, to a blockage of the autonomic nervous system in Freeze mode. This gave rise to **Somatic Experiencing** therapy, which is widely recognized in certain circles as one of the most effective methods for managing psychotrauma.

Methods like Somatic Experiencing can be broadened to address not only shock traumas, such as accidents, violence, etc., but also developmental trauma where the child is exposed to situations of chronic stress or more benign conditions that lead to *Self* atrophy, porous boundaries, etc.

Among the methods that treat developmental trauma or childhood trauma, we can note **NARM**, and also **Hakomi**.
# Hakomi Somatic Therapy
Hakomi is the main therapy modality in which I am trained, it largely forms the basis of the idea of psychotherapy that I want to practice.

It is difficult to describe the processes at play in a Hakomi session and I think you need to experience it to represent it, but I will try to give some principles.

First, there is great emotional proximity between the therapist and client, a Hakomi therapist learns to be very finely attuned to the patient's internal state and adapts in real time to their changes. This is analogous to the attunement we observe between a caregiver and a baby. This very fine attunement allows for great safety in the client and the progressive opening of defenses. This allows for welcoming and regulating all the states that can arise.

Once this "therapeutic bubble" is established, and following either the therapist's observations or a problem presented by the client, the therapeutic process can begin. The idea is to study in mindfulness how the said problem arises in the patient. What are the thoughts, emotions, sensations, movements, postures that are manifest, and what are the unconscious mechanisms, beliefs, learning, trauma that are underlying?
By studying manifest phenomena in mindfulness and immersing the client in this experience, we can access deeper unconscious structures and transform them.

*Give an example*

Here is a two part Hakomi demo by the founder of the method, Ron Kurtz.

Thus, a session will follow a general arc: Study, exploration, process, transformation, integration.
