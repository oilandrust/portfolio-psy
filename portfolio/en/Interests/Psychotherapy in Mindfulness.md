Since the third wave of CBT, mindfulness has been widely adopted as one of the tools for psychotherapy. It has been shown that the practice of mindfulness has positive effects on emotional regulation, and in CBT, these tools are used to allow patients to step back from their experience, to name their emotions, to accept discomfort and to recognize their thoughts as what they are: thoughts and not realities.

However, I would like to highlight that these contributions, although important, are only part of what mindfulness can bring to Psychotherapy.

In mindful psychotherapies, we do not use mindfulness as a stress management tool that patients can learn and use themselves, but we conduct psychotherapy itself in a state of mindfulness.

This "two-person" mindfulness was glimpsed by Freud in free association. By freely associating ideas and simply noticing what arises, thoughts, emotions, etc., we are indeed practicing mindfulness.

Moreover, the contribution of the therapist's presence allows the patient to have more capacity to be in contact with their experience. The therapist operating as the caregiver who helps the child to regulate their emotions.

This approach to therapy, notably proposed by Hakomi (Kurtz 2015), Daniel Siegel (Siegel 2007), allows for the study of the psycho-corporeal apparatus as Freud might have dreamed, not in analysis after the fact but in the present embodied moment. This also gives access to modified states of consciousness and neuroplasticity that allows rapid transformation of unconscious material, limiting schemas and working models of attachment.
