*Work in progress...*

I am interested in questions related to relationships, sexuality, and society. How these questions articulate at different levels and under various prisms, from somatic psychology, attachment theory, to economics and psychoanalysis.

My path to therapy was notably due to relational problems, and understanding how to establish sexual relationships was a significant issue. These questions are therefore at the heart of my personal journey and are also prominent in society.

Today, there is a strong polarization between sexes and genders. In my opinion, this polarization is the legacy of history, of hundreds of years of domination, transgression, and characterological adaptations. We are at a time when these structures are unraveling, and with that, a significant traumatic load is unfolding.

The work is not only to dialogue, to set new boundaries, to learn to respect them, but also to regulate this load so as to gradually let go of defense and domination strategies.

I borrow Ilan Stephanie's words, as I don't yet have her clarity:

"Egal wessen Grenzen, wie verletzt wurden, wir reparieren erstmal einfach Grenzen. Können wir die reparieren?"

"No matter whose boundaries were transgressed, no matter how: we start by simply repairing boundaries. Can we repair them?"

And this passage:

"Und auch wenn wir im Patriarchat ganz oft wahrgenommen haben an der Oberfläche, 'also, ich glaube nicht, dass Männer sich abwerten, ich glaube, die überschätzen sich.' Alles verstanden, aber in der Tiefe ist es trotzdem kollektiver männlicher Selbsthass. Es ist trotzdem nicht ein Mann sein dürfen, und das lieben dürfen."

“And even if in the patriarchy, we have often clearly understood on the surface: ‘I don’t believe that men devalue themselves, I think they overestimate themselves.’ Of course, but in depth, there is still a collective male self-hatred. It is still not being allowed to be a man and to love it.”

The postures attributed to masculinity and men, and which are condemned (rightly so), are not authentic; they are a false self hiding the shame of being a bad object.
