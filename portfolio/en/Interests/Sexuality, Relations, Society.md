I am interested in questions related to relationships, sexuality and society. How these questions articulate at different levels and through different lenses, from somatic psychology, attachment theory to economics and psychoanalysis.

My path to therapy was notably due to relational problems and understanding how to establish sexual relationships was an important issue. These questions are therefore at the heart of my personal journey and they are also strong in society.

Today there is a strong polarization between the sexes and genders. In my view, this polarization is the legacy of history, hundreds of years of domination, transgression and character adaptations. We are at a time when these structures are unravelling and with that a significant traumatic charge is unfolding.

The work is not only to dialogue, to set new boundaries, to learn to respect them but also to regulate this charge to gradually also let go of defense and domination strategies.

In my view, somatic approaches have an important role to play as they provide a framework to welcome emotions, energies, charges, etc. that arise when we approach these issues, to regulate them and to return to society, not in Fight or Flight, not in Freeze or Collapse, but with empathy, curiosity and capacity for connection.
