subtitle: What are you thinking about?

My current interest in psychotherapy is nurtured by psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches, with influence from French psychoanalysis and recent American formulations.

These approaches have in my view highlighted central aspects for healing, first the notion of the **affective unconscious**, first brought forward by Freud and then taken up in more modern contexts.

Psychoanalysis gave rise to Bowlby's theory of **attachment**, which clearly showed the importance of the quality of the bond in the first years of life for the establishment of *Inner Working Models*, another model of the unconscious.

I am also particularly interested in the modern contributions made by Allan Schore, an American Psychoanalyst who explains the relational affective unconscious as a way of being with the other that is **implicit**, **non-verbal**, and therefore unconscious, and whose neural substrates can be observed activating in relationship.

Another fundamental contribution from Freud's work is the notion of **transference**, where these implicit and unconscious models play out in the dyadic patient-therapist relationship, offering the possibility of a corrective experience leading to a new way of being with the other and the emergence of the ego or *Self*.

Finally, Freud brought his descriptions of **psychic organizations**, neurotic, narcissistic, psychotic, etc. which are in my view essential when working with a patient in psychotherapy. How much does the person in front of us have access to a solid self?

In my view, the concepts of the unconscious, attachment models, transference and psychic structures are fundamental concepts for approaching a psychotherapy that will be adapted to the person we encounter, and it is important for a therapist to train to recognize these phenomena and structures, and this not only **in discourse**, but also and especially **in the implicit and non-verbal**, with our ***right brain*** as Allan Schore suggests.
