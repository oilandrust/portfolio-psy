subtitle: Being here with you, I notice...

Having lived in Sweden and being connected to international mindfulness communities online, I have been exposed to a diversity of practices called *Relational* or *Somatic* which in my view have an interest in evolving the field of psychotherapy and relationships at a societal scale.

These practices are very strong in California or Colorado and also present in Scandinavia and Germany. They are however rare and emerging in France, perhaps because the French are slower to adopt innovations, or perhaps because of the language, these practices being generally transmitted in English.

These practices, which can be affiliated with active listening or non-violent communication, are nourished by mindfulness and psychotherapy and offer tools and practices that allow us to bring more awareness into relationships, to develop empathy, connection with the other and the body and more.

They are interesting for me not only because they have brought me in my process of maturity and healing, but also because they have the potential to transform how we are in relationship in society and bring out certain relational qualities from the closed frame of psychotherapy. They are also for me a playground to practice my relational and therapeutic skills.

My goal here is not to describe these practices precisely but to give a taste of 3 main practices: Circling (BENETEAU, 2021), Authentic Relating (Kestano, 2022) or Authentic Relations and finally somatic practices which encompass a variety of practices.

### Circling, relational mindfulness

Circling, also known in Europe as Transformational Connection, is one of the flagship practices.

The exercise in Circling is to explore, in a group, what our experience is in the present moment. It is about both revealing one's own experience and also being interested in the other's experience, here and now (Rouiller 2025), not in the narration of a past experience or a general life experience.

So for me it is a relational or group mindfulness.

So one could say "Being here with you, I notice a desire to speak and take space, but also shame. And now that I'm speaking I feel my hands becoming sweaty but seeing you attentive, I notice that I relax a bit", someone could continue by revealing how this sharing impacts them or by asking questions to learn more about this experience.
