This quite dense work by Allan Schore is an important inspiration for my therapeutic orientation. It allows me to reconcile myself with psychoanalytic approaches which sometimes seem obscure and outdated.

Allan presents therapy as a process of synchronizing our right brains, highlighting the fact that affective and non-verbal aspects in a relationship are processed by the right parts of the frontal cortex.

In light of these neurological discoveries, Allan teaches us how we can explain the unconscious. It manifests in the implicit responses and representations that come into play in the therapeutic relationship. The therapist's work is then to listen to these sometimes dissociated affects and help patients regulate them to reach a new way of being with the other.

Allan details how to explain transference, psychic organizations as well as regressions in terms of these theories, really inspiring!
