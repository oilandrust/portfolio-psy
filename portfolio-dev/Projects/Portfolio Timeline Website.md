This is the page you're currently looking at. I built it vibe coding with Cursor. It's a static website built with Vite and React, and deployed to GitHub Pages.
It's designed to be able to add projects with data while keeping the whole thing static so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

To use it, create a new folder for each project and add a project.yml file with the project details.
Then add the images and videos to the project folder, and you're good to go.

The data is extracted from the projects/ and converted to a JSON file that is used to render the content of the static page.
