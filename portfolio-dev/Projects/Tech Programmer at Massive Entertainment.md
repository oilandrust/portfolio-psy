I worked on the tech team for Avatar project for Ubisoft.
I worked on implementing and maintaining tech features for the in house Snowdrop Engine.

Some of the tech I worked on are the impostor system for tree rendering, a GI low res fallback system, fog and atmospheric effects and shaders. Tech art tools, etc....

In that job I worked closely with tech programmers in my team, in other developers using Snowdrop on other projects, as well as tech artists.
