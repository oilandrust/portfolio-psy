I worked as a contractor for Abstract to work on their game engine RSX. As I joined the team the engine was already fully functional but needed a lot of polish and bug fixing.

I contributed in a few areas, mainly the macOS platform layer, the rendering of Gizmo in the editor, scene picking and manipulation tools and editor functionalities such as shortcuts, Undo/Redo, etc...

On the macOS layer I made sure the windowing system was working robustly with multiple windows in multiple monitors, and that events were properly propagated to the engine's UI system.

I also wrote and maintained some C# code on the UI scripting layer that was built in the engine.
The engine since switched to TypeScript to be able to run the editor on the web.
